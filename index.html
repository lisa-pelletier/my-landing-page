        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>
          I started running and I enjoy it. My best run was 7km, and I have set
          an ambitious goal to run a 10km by June. I am actively working towards
          it. I have noticed a significant improvement in my physical fitness. I
          feel more energized throughout the day. Running has also helped me
          manage stress and anxiety.

        <h2>Arts</h2>
        <p>
          I have been painting eversince I was a child, either ob canvas or
          paper. Even on cardboard! In the last years, I focused a lot on
          painting mandalas, going from the smallest size (10cm canvas) to the
          largest (1,5m canvas). Painting helps me relax my mind and think about
          nothing besides my brush. Another type of art I like to do is playing
          music. I have been playing the violin for the past 15 years, and
          despite hard times learning it I now really enjoy playing romantic
          pieces.

        <h2>Job</h2>
        <p>
          Doing business studies increased my interest in marketing, in which I
          intend on pursuing a career. I will start looking for a job in that
          field in July. I did several internships already, including my end on
          studies one as a marketing assistant. I was in a real estate group in
          Geneva. What I enjoy in marketing is that it allows some creativity,
          while still being theoretical.
